* To reduce operational costs, specifically electricity consumption, at a water supply station in Hong Kong, I developed a   predict-then-optimize framework. This framework first predicts the daily water demand of Hong Kong residents based on weather data and historical water usage, and then optimizes the operation schedule of the water pumps.
The results indicate that energy consumption is expected to decrease by 5% annually through our algorithm, resulting in estimated annual savings of approximately $12,387 on electricity bills.
