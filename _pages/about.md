**I am on the academic job market for a Postdoc position starting in 2025 summer/fall.**

I am a PhD Candidate in Quantitative Marketing at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, China. Prior to this, I earned both my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

My primary research interests lie at the intersection of AI, high technology, and business, particularly in marketing contexts such as digital advertising, crowdfunding, and social media.

My main research methodologies include deep learning, machine learning, applied econometrics, and both field and laboratory experiments.
